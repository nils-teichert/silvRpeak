\title{Creates a table of hydrological predictors from river flow data}
\usage{
extract_hydro(date, quse, Qlim_class, qlimuse = "Q70", start = 9)
}
\arguments{
\item{date}{a vector of class "Date" representing calendar dates.}

\item{quse}{a numeric vector of the daily river discharge (in situ observation or prediction). Must be the same length as the date vector.}

\item{Qlim_class}{a vector with the 10 ordered  quantiles values of the river discharge, 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9 and 0.99. Must be specified by the user.}

\item{qlimuse}{a numeric value reflecting the river discharge beyond which the number of days is cumulated.If \code{qlimuse = “Q70”} (default parameter), the 0.70 discharge quantile value is used.}

\item{start}{a numeric value between 01 and 12 reflecting the month initiating the migration season (default: \code{09} September).}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the hydrological predictors.
\itemize{
  \item date : the date,
  \item bio_year : the migration season starting from the month \code{start},
  \item lunarphase : a factor variable with the 4 lunar phase labels,
  \item Q : the daily river discharge,
  \item Qlim_class : the class estimate of daily flow between 0 and 10,
  \item delta_1d : the daily flow change standardised by the river flow extent,
  \item delta_sum3d : the sum daily flow change over 3 days standardised by the river flow extent,
  \item delta_sum7d : the sum daily flow change over 7 days standardised by the river flow extent,
  \item Nday_above : the cumulative number of days above the flow threshold \code{qlimuse}.
}
}
\description{
This function uses river flow data to returns a table of hydrological predictors for the migration models.
